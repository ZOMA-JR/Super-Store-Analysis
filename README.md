 ERD represents a sales order management system with four main entities:

Customer - Stores customer details.

Orders - Tracks customer orders.

Order Details - Connects orders and products, capturing sales data.

Product - Stores product information.

Key Relationships:

One customer can place many orders.

One order can have multiple products (via Order Details).

One product can be part of many order details.

 # Functional Requirements (What the system should do)
  
Manage Customers → Store customer info like name, region, and segment.

Process Orders → Track when orders are placed, shipped, and delivered.

Manage Products → Store product details, categories, and subcategories.

Track Sales → Record what was sold, how much, and to whom.

Analyze Performance → Generate reports on sales trends, best-selling products, and customer behavior.

Manage Deliveries → Track shipping details and delivery times.

User Access Control → Restrict access so only authorized users can modify data.

# Non-Functional Requirements (How the system should perform)

Fast & Efficient → Handle many transactions quickly without slowing down.

Secure → Keep customer and sales data safe with encryption and restricted access.

Easy to Use → Simple and intuitive interface for users.

Reliable → Should be available almost all the time (99.9% uptime).

Scalable → Can handle more data and users as the business grows.

Compliant → Follows data protection laws like GDPR.
